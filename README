This is the first working version of superdelta() that does not depend on the multtest package.

In addition to being tested thoroughly, we also need to implement the following methods:

1. paired t-test.
2. Welch corrected t-test.
3. F-test.
4. Possibly a repeated measures F-test.
5. Further performance tuning by using float instead of double computing in C functions.
